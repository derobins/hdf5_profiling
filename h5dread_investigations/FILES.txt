The HDF5 files were created using h5py w/ HDF5 1.10.0 (what the package
manager gives you on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS).

The callgrind output was generated by a reader program compiled against
the develop branch of the HDF5 library as of April 22, 2020.

The library was built via the Autotools as follows:

configure --enable-build-mode=production --enable-symbols --enable-optimization=debug --disable-memory-alloc-sanity-check --enable-using-memchecker
